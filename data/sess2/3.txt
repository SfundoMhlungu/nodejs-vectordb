When Duolingo was
starting out, we were
all sitting in one room.
We didn’t have formal Product Reviews, or OKRs, or
any of the structure we have today. There was no
blueprint because no other learning app was doing
what we were trying to do. We were—for better or
worse—making things up as we went along.
We were also fast as hell. And the pace of our
experimentation allowed us to quickly figure out what
was working, and ditch what wasn’t. This applied
across everything: product, hiring, engineering, and
our business as a whole. We were testing and learning
at warp speed.
It’s still like this even today. We ship new versions of our iOS
and Android apps every week. And we’re running hundreds of
experiments* across the company at any given time. Duolingo
goes nowhere without this principle. “Ship It” keeps us ahead of
our competitors; “Ship It” makes Duolingo a fun place to work;
“Ship It” ensures that our product never sits still.
Go, Go, Go!
Duolingo is the sum of thousands of experiments. The faster
we can run experiments—successful or not—the faster we
can improve the app and advance our mission. Over time, each
of these changes builds on one another, creating a cycle of
compounding growth.
Shipping fast also lets us avoid lengthy debates and guesswork
about what we should be doing. That’s because testing in
the real world gives us better information than any internal
discussion ever could. So, we move quickly—to start these
feedback loops and let real data guide our work.
Clock Speed
“Clock speed” is a mindset that drives how we work. The concept
comes from microprocessor technology, where clock speed
measures how quickly a system can process instructions. We use
the term to talk about minimizing the gaps between actions: the
time between when a decision is made and when it’s implemented,
or when feedback is given and changes are made.
Experiments: Experiments are tests to see what works and what doesn’t. A/B tests are
a specific type of experiment where we simultaneously run two or more options against
one another.

Ruthless Prioritization
As much as we want to move fast and increase clock
speed, we always need to make sure we’re working
on the right thing. At Duolingo, prioritization is
sometimes described as “ruthless:” we are decisive
about what we focus on as a company, based on what
will have the largest impact on our learners.
Deciding what to prioritize starts with clearly defined
goals. For every initiative, we ask: How does this
contribute to our mission? What measurable outcomes
will it drive? And if something doesn’t move the needle
in a meaningful way, it’s cut—no matter how much
effort has already gone into it. One high-impact win
always outweighs a handful of small scattered efforts.
Increasing clock speed helps us reduce idle time and
make sure that the most important projects actually
get done. We should almost never have to wait a
month to see the next iteration of a project. The more
we can close these gaps, the faster we ship it, and
the faster we can learn and improve. It’s not about
rushing—it’s about never letting a break in the chain
slow us down.
This mindset extends to our product. We cut features that don’t
deliver value, remove unnecessary complexity, and stay laserfocused
on our mission. Letting go of what’s not effective is often
as powerful as creating something new.
PR: Product Review. The meeting where we green-light every
change to the app. Led by the Product Org, but anyone can listen in!
Shipping the Org
As teams grow and become more specialized, there’s a risk that our product will mirror the
organization’s structure rather than delivering a seamless experience for learners. This
is called “shipping the org.” For example, the tabs across the app—like Leaderboards and
Profile—are managed by different teams, each with distinct goals. Over time, this has led
to inconsistencies in their design. To counter this, we always need to consider the holistic
experience across the app.

Culture of Experimentation The Right Amount of Process
“Ship It” isn’t just about speed; it’s about creating
as many opportunities as possible to learn and
improve. We like to play around, run a little wild—and
sometimes fail. But each experiment brings us closer
to seeing what works.
As Duolingo grows, staying agile becomes more challenging. We
need guardrails and processes to keep things from spiraling out
of control, but we also want to avoid unnecessary red tape. The
question is: How can we add the right processes without slowing
ourselves down?
Good processes should reduce workloads, improve quality, and
lead to better decisions. One example of this is Product Review
(PR). In the early days, Luis often made product decisions
during informal meetings, which sometimes got messy. Not all
stakeholders were included or informed; even worse, it wasn’t
always clear if decisions were binding or if Luis was just musing.
We needed a better approach.
Taking inspiration from engineering’s code review process, we
introduced a formal structure for Product Review. Today, PR
ensures that everyone is clear on what decisions were made, and
that all relevant stakeholders are informed. The meeting also
includes a rotating group of leaders from Product and Design
who weigh in, ensuring diverse perspectives.
The success of PR has set a precedent for other teams.
Marketing, for instance, has adopted a Marketing Review, which
brings the same clarity and alignment to their campaigns. These
processes help us maintain our quality bar—and make faster
and visible decisions across the company.
99 Bad Ideas
Some of our best features and campaigns have come
from asking ridiculous, unlikely questions. We practice
this at leadership offsites during a tradition we call
“99 Bad Ideas,” where we brainstorm outrageous
concepts—like Duo’s latest hijinks, or changing our
stock ticker to LILY.
But this spirit extends across the organization,
where we make space for challenging assumptions
and asking bold questions. What if you could talk
with Duolingo characters? What would Duo do with
five seconds at the Super Bowl? What if language
certification tests could be taken at home? Over
the years, these types of questions have helped us
consistently uncover new opportunities to delight our
learners and advance our mission.
Navigating Trade-offs
There’s a natural tension between “Raise the Bar” and “Ship It.” When they clash, our mission
is a great guide. The question is: How will this decision improve education and make it more
accessible? Often, it means letting go of perfection. Generative AI, for example, lets us create
content at a speed and scale we never thought possible. Early versions aren’t perfect, but they
deliver value to millions now—and the quality will improve over time.
