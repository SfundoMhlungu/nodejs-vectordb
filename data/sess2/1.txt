Letter from Luis
Duolingo is a quirky place.
Our culture wasn’t copied from a tech startup playbook. It was
built from scratch by a few dozen nerds in an office above a
sports bar in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
For most of our early employees, Duolingo was their first real
job. Without much experience, we had to experiment our way
through the basic questions: Who should we hire? What’s the
best way to build an app? How should we organize ourselves
to build it? Doing it this way took time. But in the end, nothing
could have been better for our culture and success.
Over time, we’ve sharpened our answers to these questions and
many more. Now, fourteen years in, we’ve decided to put these
answers into writing, and articulate how we do things.
At the center of this book are five principles. These aren’t
aspirational—they’re lessons we've learned through experience.
But they’re also living ideas: they have tensions within them, and
there are places where they don’t always fit. We hope you study
them, challenge them, and help us make the next version of this
book even better.
Thanks for reading.
And welcome to Duolingo.
— Luis

Take the

Duolingo was never
going to be a sprint.
It wasn’t a quick experiment, or a weekend side hustle.
We knew that building the best education app in the
world would be a multidecade effort—and that it
would require patience. But patience—that is, taking
the long view—is hard.
Take advertising. We could increase revenue
tomorrow by showing more ads in the app. But we
know that too many ads can annoy users and stifle
long-term growth, potentially compromising our goal
of making the best education universally available.
This is a real trade-off. But over and over, we’ve taken
the long view. We have to: our goals are too big to
think any other way.
Not every company is able to operate like this. But we had a few
early advantages that made taking the long view possible. For
one, Luis had already sold his first company, reCAPTCHA, in
2009. As he put it: “This gave me the flexibility and perspective
to think about our mission first and foremost.”
So we set out to build something groundbreaking—the kind
of educational tool our children and grandchildren might still
be using. The clarity of this vision, along with the trust of
our earliest investors, gave us leeway as we figured out what
Duolingo could be. Equally important: we hired folks who were
just as crazy about our mission. Back then, many of them could
have doubled their salaries working at bigger tech companies.
But they didn’t come here to make a quick buck—they came here
to build the best learning tool on the planet.
The temptation of short-term wins can be powerful. We had a
simple mantra in the early days: “Don’t do dumb s**t.” Looking
back, this was the first version of “Take the Long View.” We knew
that to have any shot at meaningful success, we had to steer
clear of gimmicks and tricks that might seem helpful in the
short-term but hurt us down the road.

Don’t Do Dumb S**t

Building a Forever Product
The Duolingo app is designed to be sticky in the shortterm
and transformative in the long-term. For years,
we’ve focused on building something so useful and
delightful that it becomes an essential part of our
learners’ lives.
Learning—particularly language learning—requires
regular practice over extended periods of time. That’s
why we prioritize user retention, and have spent years
perfecting the Streak feature. The more we can do to
keep our learners committed for the long haul, the
more value they’ll get from Duolingo.
We also invest in teaching better. Even though this
doesn’t generate immediate revenue, we know that if
a product fails to deliver on its promise, people will
eventually stop using it.
Notifications
Juicy
Every day, Duolingo sends millions of messages to learners.
These notifications present a fundamental tension between
long-term thinking and short-term goals.
More notifications leads to more Daily Active Users (DAUs)*
in the short-term. But people who feel bombarded don’t stick
around for long—they eventually turn off notifications or
abandon the app entirely. That's why we put firm limits on
notifications, regardless of what the short-term metrics suggest.
User trust matters more than immediate gains.
Duolingo didn’t always look like the app you see today. For years,
it featured a light gray background, muted button colors, and a
more robotic-looking Duo. But in 2018, a few of our designers
and illustrators began working on a concept for a kids’ app. With
brighter colors, rounder corners, and a cuter, friendlier Duo, the
new design made learning feel more like a game. It was exactly
the kind of playful experience we wanted for the main app. So,
even though we didn’t expect it to boost metrics in the shortterm,
we took the leap and applied this new design language—
dubbed Juicy—across all of Duolingo.
DAUs: Daily Active Users. The number of individuals using Duolingo every day across
iOS, Android, and the website.

This redesign wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was an investment
in the future. While risky and resource intensive, it set the
foundation for the playful world that now defines our brand:
expressive characters, delightful animations, and a learning
experience that feels like play. By taking the long view, we
created a design language that would scale with the product for
years to come.
Engineering the Future
Becoming a Business
In engineering, taking the long view requires a slightly
different approach. We know that we will still be improving
our products years from now. So, we don’t build systems to
last forever. Instead, we test ideas quickly and only invest
significant engineering resources when something is successful.
If something doesn’t work, we move on quickly, keeping the
codebase clean and minimizing waste.
Video Call is a great example. We only invested in scaling and
stabilizing it for long-term use once it showed traction with
users. Another example relates to notifications. When we
realized we’d be testing notification copy for years to come, we
built a custom tool that allows Product Managers to test copy
without engineering support.
This balance—focusing on speed while reserving long-term
investments for what truly works—has guided our success.
For years, Duolingo didn’t make money. We were laser-focused
on growing our user base and keeping learners engaged. Also,
some of us worried that monetizing Duolingo could get in the
way of our mission.
That perspective began to shift after our Series D funding round
in 2015. We started exploring revenue models—in-app purchases
(IAPs), advertising, and paid subscriptions—with one key caveat:
they could never compromise our mission. We weren’t going to
put learning behind a paywall.
Setting the Proficiency Standard
When asked how much English somebody knows, we want them
to say, “My Duolingo Score is 70.” The Duolingo Score is an
estimate of users’ proficiency in the language they’re learning,
and the Duolingo English Test (DET) is a way to certify the
score that can be used for high-stakes purposes, like university
admissions. Together, they form our two-pronged approach
to becoming the standard measure for language proficiency.
Putting the score in the app gives us volume—hundreds of
millions of people see it. Having a way to certify it with the DET
gives us credibility—the score can get you admission to even the
most prestigious universities in the world.
Of course, becoming the proficiency standard is not easy, and
could take decades—but that’s exactly why the Duolingo Score
and the DET are great examples of taking the long view
